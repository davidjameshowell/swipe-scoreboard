            <h4>Swipe</h4>
            <p>Setup:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Combine the two decks of cards and shuffle thoroughly.</li>
              <li>Deal 8 cards to each player. Four cards are dealt face-down and four cards are dealt face-up. The face up cards must be played before the face down cards can be played.</li>
              <li>Then deal 12 cards to each player (excluding the Jokers) and place the remaining cards in a pile face-down.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Gameplay:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The player to the left of the dealer starts the game. After the first round, the player who won the previous round (who scored 0 points) is then the first player to act when the next round begins. The game continues in this manner, with the winner of each round starting the next round.</li>
              <li>The first player chooses a card from their hand and places it on the discard pile in the center of the table. The card played must be of the same rank as the top card of the discard pile, with the exception of 10 cards, which can be played at any time and will swipe the discard pile.</li>
              <li>If a player puts down four of the same card (known as a "swipe"), they take the entire discard pile and start a new pile with any card(s) of their choice. The other cards in the pile can be set aside in another pile away from the game discard pile.</li>
              <li>If a player is unable to play a card that is of the same or lower rank as the top card on the discard pile, they may play any other card from their hand on the discard pile. However, they must then pick up all of the cards in the discard pile and add them to their hand. This action is considered a penalty and is not desirable.</li>
              <li>Players can only pick up the discard pile if they put a card down that is of a higher rank than the top card on the discard pile.</li>
              <li>If a player picks up the discard pile, they must play a card from their hand on the new discard pile.</li>
              <li>A player can play up to four cards of the same rank at once.</li>
              <li>Players may play the face-down card after they have played the corresponding face-up card. The face-down card may match the rank of the top card on the discard pile or be lower rank than the top card on the discard pile. If a player has more cards in their hand that match the face-down card, they may play them, up to three additional cards, to swipe the discard pile.</li>
              <li>The game continues until one player has no cards remaining.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scoring:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The winner of each round scores 0 points. All other players score points based on the cards remaining in their hand.</li>
              <li>Aces are worth 1 point each, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points each, and all other cards are worth their face value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>End of the game:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 100 points.</li>
              <li>The player with the lowest cumulative score is declared the winner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional Notes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Aces are the lowest (best) rank and Kings are the highest (worst) rank.</li>
              <li>Players can only play cards of the same rank as the top card of the discard pile, except for 10 cards, which can be played at any time and will swipe the discard pile.</li>
              <li>Players can only pick up the discard pile if they put a card down that is of a higher rank than the top card on the discard pile.</li>
              <li>The game can be played with 2 or more players.</li>
              <li>The only wildcards are the 10 cards, which will swipe the discard pile away.</li>
            </ul>
